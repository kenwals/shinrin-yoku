# Shinrin-Yoku

![display of site seen from different devices](assets/readme-files/amiresponsivescreenshot.png)

This is a [promotional website](https://kenwals.github.io/shinrin-yoku/) for a forest bathing meetup group, one of its strategies is promote the importance of trees and nature. 

Forest bathing originated in Japan in the 1980s, where it is known as *Shinrin-Yoku*. It is the practice of walking in any natural environment and consciously connecting with whatâ€™s around you.

This [site](https://kenwals.github.io/shinrin-yoku/) will hopefully create a community of people who appreciate trees and nature, and maybe wish to learn more about protecting them in their local city.

## UX

### Scope

This is a fictional meetup group, so there are no limitations on the content. The site will be made to an MVP first, and if there is additional time, content/features can be added.

#### User stories

##### Visitor goals

1. As a visitor to the site, I want to read about forest bathing and its benefits, so that I can decide if I wish to take part.
2. As a visitor to the site, I want to register my details, so I can be added to an email list to receive updates.
3. As a visitor to the site, I want to view nice pictures of nature.
4. As a visitor to the site, I want to read about locations of future forest bathing events.

##### Owner goals

5. As the site owner, I want to promote my service and have participants for meetups.
6. As the site owner, I want to promote the benefits of Trees and nature in our environment. 

### Structure

Site is put together using HTML, the Bootstrap framework and CSS.

A Mobile first approach is taken - site is all on one page site with three sections, navigation menu at the top. 

Navigation between sections can be done via the navbar or by"call to action" buttons.

### Skeleton

Section 1 - Home page - Navbar at top. Hero image below. With brief headline paragraph. under that a mid-section with introduction paragraph.

Section 2 - About page -  Here is displayed various panels of either Text or images promoting forest bathing, in a gallery format.

Section 3 - Contact page - Email subscribe form, contact information and links to various social media channels in footer section.

**Wireframe**

Below is the initial wireframe.

### Surface

**Colours**

The site theme is about connecting with nature, so the colours too are connected to nature. Various shades of green or natural colours are used. Point of reference for the colours chosen are taken from the site images using a colour palette tool. 

![demonstration of colour sourcing to image](assets/readme-files/canva_swatch.png)

Root variables are used so colours can be updated quickly if revisions are needed. 

Colours used are:

- "Woodland" Green  (#4e5c28) : Used for headings and text when on light background. This colour is also used as background on footer. 
- "Green Mist"  (#c9d3aa) : Used on the background of the body and navbar.
- "Nador" Green  (#4F5C54) :  Used on the background of the mid section between hero image and about section.
- "Lemon Grass"  (#9da19a) : Used for text shadow on the hero image text, and box shadow on cards.
- White  (#FFFFFF) : used for text when on a dark background.
- WhiteSmoke  (#F5F5F5) : used for the footer icons.

![Site colour palette](assets/readme-files/colours-swatch.png)

As colours are configured using rbga() properties, these can be tweaked with opacity values to give more variety to the palette while keeping the uniformity. 

**Icons** used are from fontawesome.com. These icons are visible on buttons, the sub heading of each card in the card gallery and as the social media icons in the footer.

**Images** used are ones I took myself. The original high quality images are located [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNpAlgEAwPS5Pjltq_81afFH2kgaHUYhmgoE-poGQhNGkx4mknGbwwCHOTYylgYRw?key=bEFOWWloNGJ6REdpbEZDRzVjd3BROWREaEprTXF3). Images are in jpg format and have been compressed. 

**Fonts** : 

![Sample of fonts selected](assets/readme-files/google-font-sample.png)

- **"Shadows Into Light"** was used for Header (h1,h2 and h3) text elements
- **"Montserrat"** was used for all other text. 

On slow connections, another font may be visible while the site is loading.

## Features

The site is laid out on one page that has several sections.

### Existing Features

- It is responsive to screen size thanks to bootstrap.

- The navbar remains fixed to the top of the screen, and collapses into a hamburger button on smaller screens.

- One of the image cards (title: improving air quality) in the gallery is hidden on small screens to improve flow of the page.

- There is form validation on subscription form, an alert displays if name or email fields are empty. 

- In the first two sections a call to action button prompts the user to another section. 

- Hover animations are used on the cards (box shadow appears) in the about section and the social media icons (grow in size) in the footer section.

- Contrasting colours and aria labels are used to ensure site supports visually impaired visitors. 

- Some images of trees can be clicked on and the user will be brought to [another site](https://www.curio-eco.com/world/tagged-trees/2538832?lat=53.34427142201096&lng=-6.316257453758462&zml=18) that pinpoints the exact location of the tree.
  
### Features Left to Implement

- Have the subscription form add the visitor details to an email list database.
