![display of site seen from different devices](assets/readme-files/amiresponsivescreenshot.png)

This is a [promotional website](https://kenwals.github.io/shinrin-yoku/) for a forest bathing meetup group , one of it's strategies is promote the importance of trees and nature. 

Forest bathing originated in Japan in the 1980s , where it's known as *Shinrin-Yoku*. It's the practice of walking in any natural environment and consciously connecting with what’s around you.

This [site](https://kenwals.github.io/shinrin-yoku/) will hopefully create a community of people who appreciate trees and nature, and maybe wish to learn more about protecting them in their local city.

## UX

### Scope

This is a fictional meetup group, so there is no limitations on the content . The site will be made to an MVP first, and if there is additional time, content/features will can be added.

**User stories**

1. As a visitor to the site, I want to read about forest bathing and it's benefits, so that I can decide if I wish to take part.
2. As a visitor to the site, I want to register my details , so I can be added to an email list to receive updates.
3. As a visitor to the site, I want to view nice pictures of nature.
4. As a visitor to the site, I want to read about locations of future forest bathing events.
5. As the site owner , I want to promote my service and have participants for meetups.
6. As the site owner , I want to promote the benefits of Trees and nature in our environment. 

### Structure

Site is put together using HTML, the Bootstrap framework and CSS.

Site is one page with three sections , suitable for visits from mobile phones. Navigation between sections can be done via the navbar or by call to action buttons .

### Skeleton

Mobile use a first approach - one page site , navigation menu at the top. 

Section 1 - Home page - Navbar at top . Hero image below. With brief headline paragraph. under that a mid section with introduction paragraph.

Section 2 - About page -  Here is displayed various panels of either Text or images promoting forest bathing , in a gallery format.

Section 3 - Contact page - Email subscribe form , contact information and links to various social media channels in footer section.

**Wireframe**

Below is the initial wireframe.

![initial wireframe](assets/wireframe/Wireframe_1.jpg)

### Surface

**Colours**

As the site theme is connecting with nature , the colours too are connected to nature. Various shades of green or natural colours are used. Point of referance for the colours of the site are taken from the images using a colour palette tool. 

![demonstration of colour sourcing to image](assets/readme-files/canva_swatch.png)

Root variables are used so colours can be updated quickly if revisions are needed. 

Colours used are:

- "Woodland" Green  (#4e5c28) : Used for headings and text when on light background. This colour is used as background on footer. 
- "Green Mist"      (#c9d3aa) : Used on the background of the body and navbar.
- "Nador" Green     (#4F5C54) :  Used on the background of the mid section between hero image and about section.
- "Lemon Grass"     (#9da19a) : Used for text shadow on the hero image text.
- White                     : used for text.
- Whitesmoke                : used for the footer icons.

![Site colour palette](assets/readme-files/colours-swatch.png)

As colours are configured using rbga properties , these can be tweaked with opactity values to give more variety to the palette while keeping the uniformity. 

**Icons** used are from fontawesome.com . these icons are visible on buttons , the sub heading of each card in the card gallery and for the social media icons in the footer.

**Images** used are ones I took myself. The original high quality images are located [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipNpAlgEAwPS5Pjltq_81afFH2kgaHUYhmgoE-poGQhNGkx4mknGbwwCHOTYylgYRw?key=bEFOWWloNGJ6REdpbEZDRzVjd3BROWREaEprTXF3).

**Fonts** : 

![Sample of fonts selected](assets/readme-files/google-font-sample.png)

**"Shadows Into Light"** was used for Header (h1,h2 and h3) text elements

**"Montserrat"**​ was used for all other text. 

On slow connections , another font may be visible while the site is loading.

## Testing

I tested the site as i went along, manual testing myself or automated testing using online tools (listed below). I focused on getting the site working on a small mobile phone screen first (iPhone 5 simulation on the Chrome Developer tools), and then subsequently all other screen sizes.

Utilities/channels used for testing were:

- [lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) report in Chrome devtools.

- http://ami.responsivedesign.is/

- [Accessibility](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) insight for the web (microsoft)

- Peer review channel on slack

- Simulated Devices on Developer tools in Chrome and sometimes on Firefox Developer Edition.

- Friends and family.

- checking every smart device i had within reach.

### Bugs encountered on the way

1. Navbar was not expanding collapsing correctly. its turns out i choose the wrong emmet shortcut when starting the site. So the incorrect version of bootstrap and javascript was choosen. Once i replaced both the navbar worked correctly.
3. Git commit issue , in the beginning i was using only git on the command line . Somehow not all my commits were appearing in Github when i pushed them . The problem maybe linked to me using gitpod in more then one browser (chrome and firefox) while i was trying to debug something else. I resolved this issue by git commiting with the Gitpod UI instead.
4. Page title was too long for mobile phone viewing , it was causing the hamburger button onto a new line. Fix was made by adding a media query to allow the h1 title font size reduced for smaller screens.
4. CSS comments , i made a mistake with the format used initially for commenting in the CSS file. I was using the javascript format (//)for commenting, this resulted in a problem with the colours not displaying correctly for a while in the infant version of the site.
5. Images missing on github pages even though they worked in gitpod environment. fix for this was to input a "." in the begining of image file address. 

### Known issues

1. On medium and larger screens the navbar items flicker after they have been selected.
2. When tested on my smart tv browser, the background colours don't show for hero text , mid section text and footer section. 
3. Unable to customize the ul for locations card in the card gallery, I haven't yet figured out how to over-ride the bootstrap style .
4. The navbar items text needs to be bolder to be WCAG AAA compliant for visually impaired visitors. I haven't yet figured out how to over-ride the bootstrap style .

### Project barriers and solutions

#### The navbar 

It was desirable to have the navbar menu float at the top of the screen , but i had difficulty getting the menu to collapse itself automatically with Bootstrap or CSS. But I seen [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36405991/bootstrap-toggle-menu-on-one-page-site-does-not-uncollapse-when-clicked/36406437#36406437) mentioned on Slack, so I included this trick in the navbar links. 

#### Gitpod

Gitpod has been an enemy of mine on some ocassions , i have lost work a few times with it. I may have to use another IDE option on future projects. 

### Version control

For version control i used the UI on gitpod for making commits, and command line for branches, Merging was done on the Github site. I used branches when i was working on new features , some branchs were scrapped didn't make it to the master.

### Functionality Testing

Navbar : all the links work, this section is reponsive to screen size, menu collapses after item is selected.

Hero image and text: clearly visible/readable , call to action button takes user to the about section.

About section: The card gallery is a template taken from the bootstrap framework library . It is reponsive to screen size off the shelf. No issues found. 

Email link on contact page: This behaves as expected, the link should trigger the users browser to open a new window for composing an email , the To field and the subject field should be prepopulated.

Subscription form : The form displays validation messages if fields are blank when the subscribe button is pressed. 

Footer section : All icons animate when the mouse is hovering over them, each icon links to a new page.

Devices manually tested browser for the following devices on:  

- Android Mobile phone  (Screen width 320px)        Samsung Galaxy SIII
- Android Mobile phone  (Screen width 360px)        Oneplus one
- Android Mobile phone  (Screen width 412px)        Oneplus six 
- Android Tablet        (Screen width 600px) sm     Google NEXUS 7
- Smart TV WEBOS        (Screen width 1920px) lg    LG 
- Windows laptop        (Screen width 2560px)       Dell XPS
  

### CSS3 validator 

a Problem with jigsaw is that it does not recognise root variables and rgba combinations. [source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables) . 
Apart from this , there is no validation issues. 

### HTML5 validator

Initially I did have typos and invalid synthax , all issues resolved .  No validation errors to report now.

### Usability Testing

I shared the project on the peer review channel and also with frends/family. No major usability issues were raised.

The Validation reports [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) Accessibility and [Microsofts Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) gave me interesting insights on issues that would impact visually imparied visitors to the site, as a result i made efforts to improve access for this audience. 

### Compatibility Testing

| Screen size\Browser                          | Chrome | Firefox | Edge |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ---- |
| Android Mobile phone (Screen width 320px) xs |        |         |      |
| Android Mobile phone (Screen width 412px) xs |        |         |      |
